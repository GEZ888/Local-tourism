# Local tourism

Project of the website about local tourism created with using **HTML, CSS, SCSS**

The bulleted list tag `<ul>` was used in the site header, when creating the navigation menu.

A pseudo class `:last-child` has also been applied in the navigation.

In the process of work, the following properties were involved with: 

1. **FLEX**
2. **GRID**
